Predefined Rulesets

  Maven Checkstyle Plugin no longer contains any predefined rulesets. Instead it
  references rulesets from other places:

   * {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/sun_style.html}<<<sun_checks.xml>>>}}

   * {{{http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/google_style.html}<<<google_checks.xml>>>}}

   * {{{/shared/maven-shared-resources/maven_checks.html}<<<config/maven_checks.xml>>>}}

   []

  In versions up to and including 2.13 the plugin included the
  <<<config/maven_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. In version 2.14 this was
  moved to {{{/shared/maven-shared-resources/}maven-shared-resources}}. It is
  still available to use, because maven-shared-resources has been added as a
  dependency to Maven Checkstyle Plugin

  In versions up to and including 2.13 the plugin included the
  <<<config/avalon_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. This was removed in
  version 2.14.

  In versions up to and including 2.14 the plugin included the
  <<<config/turbine_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. This was removed in
  version 2.15.

  In versions up to and including 2.15 the plugin included the
  <<<config/sun_checks.xml>>> predefined ruleset. This was removed in
  version 2.16 and the plugin instead references the original configuration
  provided by the Checkstyle project.

  In versions 2.16 and later the plugin references the <<<google_checks.xml>>>
  predefined ruleset. This is a configuration provided by the Checkstyle
  project.
